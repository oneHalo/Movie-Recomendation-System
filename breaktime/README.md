Hi there!

This is a react js front end for the breakTime project written using material ui components
https://mui.com/

It dosen't work as intended, as I had to write the front end in a rush, but it's pretty close


HOW TO RUN
- first run 'npm install'

and then you can run the project on port 3000 with

'npm run start'
