Hi there!

This is the backend / API for the breaktime project.

* note the db connection assumes you have an account called user 1 with a password iLoveMovies123

The server starts from server.js and breaks down into sever 'routes' for all the different api endpoints.
There are also sever controllers for interacting with the database using the db connection

The dbms I chose to use was MySQL / MariaDB. The tables can be found in /tables, and if you run that script in order
you should be able get all the tables for the project.

## RUN THE PROJECT
- to run the api, first run 'npm install' and then run 'npm run devStart' to start the api on port 8000
