BreakTime: Your Personalized Movie and TV Show Cataloging & Rating Platform

The primary goal of this project was to create a web application for users to rate and catalogue TV shows and movies. This notion was motivated by frustrations with current platforms which heavily rely on biased “professional” critic reviews, inaccurately evaluating movies/shows we know and love for personal reasons or external motivation. We took inspiration from the well-known “MyAnimeList” (MAL) which thrived in their trade stemming from similar incentives and dominated despite comparable platforms. The users of our system are categorized as “critics” who all have equal power in determining overall ratings. They are looking for a platform to log their entertainment, free of media conglomerate authority.
